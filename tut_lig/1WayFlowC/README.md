### 1-way flow coupling
### This simulation involves inserting particles into slot across a horizontal air
### stream that applies a force to the particles and pushes them sideways, creating
### a pile-up at the far end of the slot. The focus here is on the use of the applied
### body force to act as a weak 1-way coupled flow field. While not a general substitute
### for the full 2-way coupling, it is useful in some circumstances.
